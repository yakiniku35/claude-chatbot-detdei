# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in this project. Your reports help keep users safe.

This repository: yakiniku35/claude-chatbot-detdei

## Supported Versions
We support the latest commit on the default branch. If you believe a vulnerability affects a released version or a specific tag, please include that information in your report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Preferred)
Preferred method:
1. Use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository: open a private security advisory via the "Security" tab → "Create a new security advisory".
2. If you cannot use an advisory, open a new issue with “[SECURITY]” in the title and set the issue to draft/private if possible, or contact the maintainers directly (see alternative methods below).

When reporting, please include:
- A clear summary of the issue.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or a minimal reproducible example.
- The version/commit/tag affected.
- Any potential impact and exploitability details.
- Suggested mitigation or fixes if available.
- Your contact email for follow-up (optional).

If you need encrypted communication, tell us in your initial report and we will publish a PGP key for encrypted messages.

## Alternative Contact
If the Security Advisory workflow is not available to you, please contact the maintainer:
- GitHub username: @yakiniku35 (open a private issue or reference in the Security Advisory)
(If you prefer an email contact, provide the desired address and we will add it here.)

## Response Process and Timeline
- Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- Triage: We will triage and assign a priority within 5 business days.
- Fix: For high or critical issues we aim to produce a fix or mitigation within 30 days. For lower-severity issues, timelines may vary.
- Coordination: We will coordinate disclosure with you when possible; if no coordination is requested or agreed, we may follow standard vulnerability disclosure timelines.

## Severity and Public Disclosure
We ask reporters to refrain from public disclosure until the issue is reasonably mitigated or patched and a coordinated disclosure decision is made. If you publicly disclose before coordination, we reserve the right to respond publicly as needed.

## Safe Harbor
We will not take legal action against security researchers who follow these guidelines and test in good faith. Please do not exploit reported vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

## Credit
If you want to be credited in release notes or the repository for reporting the issue, let us know in your report and how you would like to be named.

## Dependencies
If you believe the vulnerability is in a third-party dependency rather than this repository's code, please include details about the dependency (name, version, how it is used) and we will help triage and coordinate submission upstream if appropriate.

## After a Fix
When a fix is ready, we will:
- Publish a security advisory or release notes describing the issue (without exposing exploitation details).
- Recommend upgrades/patches and any mitigation steps for users.

Thank you for helping improve the security of this project.
